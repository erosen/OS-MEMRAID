To compile, load, and unload the vmemraid module:
- Open Terminal.
- $ cd vmemraid
- $ make
- If the compile is successful, you will have a file
named vmemraid.ko. This is the compiled kernel
module.
- $ sudo insmod vmemraid.ko
- This command load the module into the kernel.
- $ sudo lsmod
- This command lists all currently loaded modules.
- Your should see a listing for vmemraid.
- $ sudo rmmod vmemraid
- This command unloads the module.
To partition and format a block device:
Once your module works to the point that it successfully
registers a block device with the system, you will see a file
called /dev/vmemraid. This is the device file that represents
your “disk”.
To create a file system on your “disk”, you must first use the
fdisk utility to partition the disk:
-
-
-
-
-
-
$ sudo fdisk /dev/vmemraid
Type n, and press enter (new partition).
Type p, and press enter (primary partition).
Type 1, and press enter (partition 1).
Press enter for all following prompts to select defaults.
When you come back to the fdisk prompt, type p to display
the partition table.
- If you see a single Linux partition, you have correctly
partitioned your write.
- Type w, and press enter (write partition table and exit).
After you partition your disk, you will see an additional device
file has been created: /dev/vmemraid1
This new file represents the partition that you have created on
the disk. You can now create a file system on your new
partition:
- $ sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/vmemraid1
- This will create a Linux ext3 file system on your
partition.
After you have created the file system, you must “mount” it to
make use of it:
- $ mkdir /home/vadmin/vmemraid_mnt (this creates an empty
directory to serve as a “mount point”, only necessary the
first time).
- sudo mount /dev/vmemraid1 /home/vadmin/vmemraid_mnt
You should now have your “disk” mounted at /home/vadmin/
vmemraid_mnt.
You may verify that the disk is mounted by typing:
!
$ df
KEEP IN MIND THAT UNLESS YOUR DRIVER IS 100% WORKING, YOU WILL
BE UNLIKELY TO COMPLETE ALL OF THESE STEPS.
To drop/add memdisks using the supplied RAID Utility:
- First, load the vmemraid module as instructed above.
- $ cd ~/vmemraid
- $ sudo ./raidutil/raidutil /dev/vmemraid list
- This will list the currently attached memdisks.
- $ sudo ./raidutil/raidutil /dev/vmemraid drop n
- This will drop the disk at location n.
- $ sudo ./raidutil/raidutil /dev/vmemraid new n
- This will create a new disk at location n.
